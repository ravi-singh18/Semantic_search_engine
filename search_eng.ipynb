the movie will start immediately after this disclaimer i i hush silence i watch any video online with open subtitles free browser extension osdb link ext i what is this this is ridiculous i i i think

i i don t show off in english you re a moron i what nonsense is this okay okay unparliamentary words in the parliament i ve taken note of all the expletives thrown against me stop it but unlike them i will uphold the dignity wake up lola uphold the dignity of the house i just want to say one thing before the formation of any reformation i will kill you before the evolution of any revolution the person who proposed it was always shunned by the people be it aristotle socrates galileo or me but let me announce something had you waited they d have passed the bill sorry sir even though i didn t pass my class exams i will make sure i pass the gun bill today face to face interview with rithwik sodhi a pen to write with a gun to defend with is the slogan coined by defense minister rithwik sodhi in a country where not everyone has access to drinking water gun amendment bill has been proposed to give guns to every family so how did you even get this idea instead of asking how i got this idea be ashamed for never getting this idea alright i m ashamed now answer me mr somaraj my name is nagaraj mr raj what would you do if thieves broke into your house i d panic sad ideally thieves should panic before breaking into your house and i ll make sure they do and how is that what would you do after panicking i ll call the cops will thieves wait until the cops arrive no they ll flee by then what do cops do when thieves flee they chase them or shoot them with a gun what if you had that gun all along do you get my drift no i don t exactly nobody seems smart enough to get my drifts and skids so you encourage keeping deadly weapons in our homes mr prakash raj how do you chop vegetables i don t my wife does patriarchy i', 'sure they do and how is that what would you do after panicking

patriarchy i m not asking who chops vegetables at your house i m asking how you chop vegetables with a knife isn t knife a deadly weapon too you can chop vegetables with a knife and also kill people with a knife will you ask for a ban on knives too if knives are as deadly why not use only knives why guns with a knife we can only stab the people nearby we can t shoot down fleeing thieves but if we go on providing guns to everyone we aren t providing guns to everyone mr dhanraj there are many sets of rules and regulations offers and obligations references and recommendations can you name a few you know like aadhar card we have aayudh card then we have gun seva gun bheema program graduate gun scheme also we will provide free guns to those who pay income taxes people will pay taxes on time at least to get a free gun it s a win win situation don t you think people will start taking the law in their hands after this law is not a paper straw for people to take in their hands mr dil raj but people will take guns in their hands and kill each other no they won t how can you be so sure i have a gun on me right now no i don t but imagine i do i d shoot you if you are unarmed but if you have a gun i won t risk it i ll be wary i ll be cautious an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind but a gun for a gun kills none why you don t consider nuns as people i meant n o n e none not n u n

homicide i was on my way home and i picked up the call what s up somebody thought they had a db but no she s alive not well they don t need us here well what happened some girl unconscious unresponsive went into cardiac arrest teenage heart attack are you absolutely sure she hadn t taken any drugs not while she was with me what she might have done before i picked her up i don t know we were having a few drinks she seemed perfectly all right then all of a sudden she started to complain about pains in her chest and she wanted to lie down on the couch and the next thing it was like she

drugs quiet let him talk he doesn t know what he s talking about you say you gave her cocaine yes we talked her into it she didn t want to she wanted to leave we didn t let her go we held her down

remain silent anything you say can be used against you in a court of law you have the right to have an attorney present during questioning if you cannot afford an attorney you have the right to have one appointed for you prior to questioning do you understand these rights yes will you voluntarily answer my questions i think i d like to talk to an attorney dr keller please dr keller please can i help you yes rhonda burke my sister is she here just a moment please well is she all right what s happened to her if you just have a seat the doctor will be right with you let me see her where is she that s rhonda burke s sister thank you i ll take care of it i m sorry miss burke we did everything we could no there s no way these kids are going to get off they re guilty jeff wyatt s confession won t be admissible as evidence in court therefore these punks will get off how he volunteered that confession miranda does not apply unfortunately melvin belli would put holes all through that testimony you are so cynical try and have a little faith in the american system of justice i am cynical but it has nothing to do with justice it has everything to do with this prosecutor he s overmatched by belli he volunteered the confession he s guilty they re all guilty so was miranda and the state will further establish that the victim s death was a direct result of the ingestion of cocaine a drug provided by the defendants and that the resultant heart attack suffered by rhonda burke was induced by the drug and by their sexual assault the prosecution will prove that these men are in fact guilty of both rape and murder thank you mr belli your opening statement please yes your honor may it please you your honor and of course may it please you ladies and gentlemen of the jury i want to make just a very brief opening statement to set out some guideposts so that you can determine that my clients are not guilty your honor ladies and gentlemen of the jury these young men who are sitting here are', 'rhonda burke was induced by the drug and by their sexual assault the prosecution will prove that these men are in fact guilty of both rape and murder thank you mr belli your opening statement please yes your honor may it please you your honor and of course may it please you ladies and gentlemen of the jury i want to make just a very brief opening statement to set out some guideposts so that you can determine that my clients are not guilty your honor ladies and gentlemen of the jury these young men who are sitting here are the real victims in this case victims of a public outrage against drug abuse which all of us feel and rightly so certainly it s tragic that rhonda burke may have died of cocaine poisoning but that s not justification for making these boys scapegoats no cocaine was found in their possession or in the house where rhonda burke died in fact the only cocaine ever found in this case was in the body of rhonda burke proximity to an event is not evidence of complicity i will establish and prove that all that these boys are guilty of is something that all of us have been guilty of at some time in our lives being in the wrong place at the wrong time thank you prosecution may call its first witness and what did you find to be the cause of death cardiorespiratory arrest due to cocaine and did your examination also indicate that the deceased had been violated objection violated its leading and suggestive to his own witness sustained there was evidence that she had engaged in sexual intercourse a short time prior to her death i see and was there any indication of physical injury to the deceased bruises on her facial cheeks arms and thighs your witness deep lasting bruises or mild faint bruises no they were intermediate by the way was rhonda burke a smoker yes did she take oral contraceptives objection overruled witness will answer we found evidence of that yes so you did find evidence of that don t those factors smoking and the pill increase the lethal potential of cocaine that is the medical consensus yes is it also possible rhonda burke may have lacked the necessary enzyme to metabolize the cocaine we didn t test for that thank you oh there s another thing about those bruises aren t there people who bruise quite easily i mean in response to actions less than violent yes yes there are and couldn t those bruises have come from some amorous adventure in the front seat of this little sport objection withdrawn withdrawn no further questions and what happened after you arrived at the address the paramedic team was already attempting to resuscitate the victim so i began to question the witnesses who were present in regard to the circumstances and what happened shortly thereafter one of the witnesses jeffrey wyatt voluntarily confessed that', 's another thing about those bruises aren t there people who bruise quite easily i mean in response to actions less than violent yes yes there are and couldn t those bruises have come from some amorous adventure in the front seat of this little sport objection withdrawn withdrawn no further questions and what happened after you arrived at the address the paramedic team was already attempting to resuscitate the victim so i began to question the witnesses who were present in regard to the circumstances and what happened shortly thereafter one of the witnesses jeffrey wyatt voluntarily confessed that he and the other defendants provided the victim with cocaine and subsequently raped her and during the rape she suffered a seizure and you recorded this confession i did request that this officer s notes be admitted as evidence no no your honor as people s exhibit a the defense request that the ruling on admissibility of these notes or alleged notes be continued until completion of our cross examination granted any more questions no your honor mr belli your witness did you find any cocaine on the premises no sir were there any signs of any kind of a struggle no and very importantly now did you read mr wyatt his rights before you recorded his alleged statement i didn t because at the time he wasn t just answer the question it s simple enough you read it or you didn t read it did you advise mr wyatt that he had the right to legal counsel before answering any questions no i m trying to tell you he wasn t in custody at the time he made a voluntary statement that took me completely by surprise he volunteered the statement defense requests that the court rule this officer as a hostile witness and if your honor would ask him to answer where he can yes or no not an elaborate statement so directed now officer myers isn t it true and this is very important that mr epperson asked if he could leave and go to the hospital with rhonda burke answer the question please you don t have to look at anybody to give an honest answer to that yes and wasn t this prior to mr wyatt s alleged confession yes but he wasn t you ve answered the question your honor i submit that this witness s testimony that the defendants had in fact been detained establishes they should have been advised of their miranda rights to remain silent and to have legal counsel they weren t since they were not so advised mr wyatt s alleged statement is not admissible in evidence does prosecution have anything to say your honor the people maintain that the defendant s confession was not coerced nor was he in the custody of officer myers at the time his statement was made voluntarily as a free citizen in response to general questioning in the normal fact finding process', 'this witness s testimony that the defendants had in fact been detained establishes they should have been advised of their miranda rights to remain silent and to have legal counsel they weren t since they were not so advised mr wyatt s alleged statement is not admissible in evidence does prosecution have anything to say your honor the people maintain that the defendant s confession was not coerced nor was he in the custody of officer myers at the time his statement was made voluntarily as a free citizen in response to general questioning in the normal fact finding process associated with such an incident i can understand how the state would take such a view and how the officer could be completely unaware of the fact that a crime had been committed short of such information being volunteered however officer myers testimony indicates that the defendants were deprived of their freedom of action in a significant way the law is very clear on this point they should have been advised of their rights since they were not regardless of the fact that i may personally wish to admit the defendant s statement as evidence in good conscience i have no choice but to rule for the defense the jury will disregard officer myers testimony in regard to a statement made by defendant jeffrey wyatt and the officer s notes in this regard are inadmissible as evidence exception your honor noted proceed the prosecution rests mr belli you may present your case thank you your honor but the defense at this time contends that the prosecution has failed to establish a reasonable connection or a nexus between the defendants and the crimes for which they have been charged therefore we move that the court direct the jury to find a verdict of acquittal mr belli there is absolutely no question in the court s mind that these young men committed the acts with which they ve been charged there is also no question in the court s mind that their rights under the miranda decision have been violated this is a particularly odious example of what can happen when errors of this sort are made unfortunately i have no choice but to drop the charges at this time order order in the court jury is dismissed the defendants will be released from custody this court is adjourned that s insane they are guilty one of them confessed they re guilty bailiff remove that woman you ll

ballistics did you pretty good with it are you i m sorry to say it but yes i am women s club champion i ve been to the nationals two years in a row now you know i was thinking isn t there like a police artist that could draw a sketch of that man i saw at the gas station yeah there is but there s not enough motivation in this case for that yet don t the police have any interest in trying to prove somebody else did it my partner thinks somebody else may have done it but you don t i can t believe this you think i killed him sheila if somebody raped and murdered my sister and got off scot free on some sort of technicality i could kill them plead diminished capacity and not spend one single day in jail well i appreciate the free counsel sergeant but i didn t kill the man and i m not pleading insanity i was upset about the verdict and i did say some things in the heat of the moment but i didn t shoot phillip epperson i think you did why i think you felt those boys deserve to die

after the car has been stolen mr kephardt we could not arrest sheila burke on the first homicide because suspicion doesn t do it we know it wouldn t stick if you re a betting man i ll give you odds that her attorney mr snow will', 'understand you are the officers investigating robert s death yes we are well why haven t you arrested her you mean sheila burke who in hell else would i be referring

homicide because suspicion doesn t do it we know it wouldn t stick if you re a betting man i ll give you odds that her attorney mr snow will have her out today by pm i was told that robert and his friend philip epperson were killed by the same gun and you re telling me she s going to be released we checked out sheila burke s gun it was not the gun that was used in these homicides mr kephardt we re conducting a thorough investigation of miss burke in fact sergeant hunter as of the last time we discussed it was thoroughly convinced of her guilt and was working to prove it my point is if she had been in custody robert would still be alive it s absolutely scandalous and if my ears aren t deceiving me it s you two who on your own decided not to arrest her after the first killing mr kephardt we are well aware of the clout you have in this city however when it comes down to our police work you have none i have things to do captain you re excused i don t happen to abuse my clout as you call it sergeant hunter but if and when i decide to use it you ll know it s being used great obviously you know something about that loud mouthed arrogant creep that gives him clout what is it his old man left his fortune to the kephardt fund for progress and to his four sons by four different marriages are you saying that that is robert kephardt s half brother he s also the sole executor of that fund very influential in political circles i think i d like to do a little work on him you do that i ll work on sheila hunter yeah thank you attorney michael snow just sprung sheila from the slammer miss burke we ve got a statement for you one more to go miss burke why did you do it you re an expert marksman would you care to comment on that hold it miss burke is free because the district attorney admits that there was insufficient evidence to bring her to trial ok how about a statement from you your public wants to know miss burke they deserve miss burke hey sheila we re behind you go for it sergeant hunter would you please get in the car i have to talk to you give em hell sheila do you mind telling me why you invited him to', 'one more to go miss burke why did you do it you re an expert

telling me why you invited him to join us because he s my best witness was i or was i not with you last night after you see i couldn t have done it do you agree with that no what you could have made it from your house at that time at night to robert kephardt s in about minutes but he was shot inside a locked building yes however you could have followed the car into the gate before it closed i can t believe this you still think i killed him well didn t you don t answer that no you are funny what you seem to be saying is that by some sheer dumb luck she got there just as this kid drove in now is that your theory that s about it yeah i want you out of this car now pull over i think you meant it sheila what when you said you wanted those kids dead don t answer that get out i ll be seeing you not if i can help it where you been well i took a little ride with sheila burke and michael snow you re kidding me he let you get close enough to talk to her yep i don t believe it neither does michael snow he kicked me out i had to walk back to the car what d you do tell him you thought she was guilty yeah she isn t yes she is no she s not listen to this the late mr kephardt left shares of his stock to each of his four kids and shares of the stock to the kephardt fund now that was years ago now at that time kephardt stock was selling for about a share so in other words david kephardt got stock worth million and the fund got the same amount now that is a lot of money but is it clout it all depends what the stock s worth no it doesn t because david kephardt traded in his shares and the fund shares for nice safe and secure bonds so what s your point all of his sons got their shares when they turned except for robert because he didn t make it to he was just so his shares went into the kephardt fund in accordance with his father s will so what are they worth now they were split to', 'and the fund got the same amount now that is a lot of money but is it clout it all depends what

except for robert because he didn t make it to he was just so his shares went into the kephardt fund in accordance with his father s will so what are they worth now they were split to in and split again two for one in so robert had shares selling at when he died and that comes to just a wee bit over million bucks and that is clout and david kephardt got it as soon as his half brother died you mean the fund got it i ve been thinking i d like to talk to sheila burke who is it it s sergeant mccall i m sorry but mr snow says i can t talk to you sergeant hunter isn t with me i m by myself i don t want to question you i just want to speak with you for a minute all right please come in thank you i tried calling you but i got a recording on your line that said the phone was out of order it s off the hook can you believe it people even reporters call and ask me when i m going to kill the third one and they sound anxious some of them even offered to help isn t that sick i m glad you think so may i sit down oh yes of course thank you i just wanted to ask you a couple more questions about that phone call you received could you describe the voice for example did you note an accent i don t really remember an accent but then i really wasn t listening for that you know more to the words well if you heard the voice again do you think you might be able to recognize it well i don t know i guess anything s possible do you have another phone in the house yes i do would you mind going to that and picking it up when i tell you and listen ok yes i have a sergeant mccall from the police department on line one will you speak with her very well put her through this is david kephardt yes i thought that you would like to be informed that sheila burke could not be detained by the da s office they said that the reason was the inability to connect the suspect to the crime sergeant to the extent that i blamed you and sergeant hunter personally for what happened you have my apology but any system which allows a self confessed killer to run loose ought to be chunked i make no apology', 'a sergeant mccall from the police department on line one will you speak with her very well put her

course not i just thought you d like to be informed thank you for your time who was that did you recognize the voice well i couldn t swear to it on a bible but the person who called me had that same prep school like accent maybe it wasn t a woman hunter some kid s been waiting down the hall to see you all afternoon his name s jeffrey wyatt thank you what can i do for you oh yeah i was wondering if i could get some police protection i don t think so hey rob and phil are dead can t you put me in protective custody or something there s a crazy woman out there killing people and i could be next yep you sure could be but guarding you right now is not in our budget so what are you saying i should just disappear what well i could put you in county jail jeffrey but i don t think the inmates are going to treat me too kindly whether you like it or not the case against us was dismissed on a technicality what do you want me to do go home and play sitting duck for some crazed female i don t care what you do but you can t hang around here jeff you don t give a damn if i get blown away do you you d just assume she d killed me too it s not important what i think right now we just can t help you sorry so this is where you go to practice killing people who are you and what do you want you know who i am you saw me in the courtroom i want you to know that the police aren t going to take any action against you i am i m going to prove that you killed my brother if it takes every cent i have i didn t kill your brother and i m really sorry about what i said at the trial like hell you are you made what amounts to a public confession and here you are practicing for the next killing don t talk to me about', 'who are you and what do you want you know who i am you saw me in the courtroom i want you to know that the police aren t going to take any action against you i am i m going to prove that you killed my brother if it takes every cent i have i didn t kill your brother and i m really sorry about what i said at the trial like hell you are you made what amounts to a public confession and here you are practicing for the next killing don t talk to me about confessions jeffrey geoffrey wyatt confessed and that lawyer you hired got it thrown out of court i didn t hear you screaming about justice then not when your brother would have been convicted of rape and murder robert never touched your sister they proved that it s a tragedy that she died but killing my brother didn t bring her back i swear to god i ll see you answer for what you ve done stop sounding so pious sergeant mccall was talking to someone on the phone today and now i know who it was you what are you talking about you re the one who called me the one who tricked me into going out to malibu at the exact time philip epperson was being killed you re the suspect now not me i still don t know what you re talking about you re not making any sense you re saying that i killed my own brother not me the police but i want you to know i m going to do everything i can to help them prove it was you if it wasn t for your lousy money money you never even earned those creeps would have paid for their crime you know as long as we re kicking around possible suspects i got one you two haven t thought of melvin belli no i m talking about that third kid jeffrey wyatt jeffrey wyatt he came in here today looking for protection it s not jeff so that could be a great cover right i mean he felt guilty enough to confess right yeah all right so maybe the guilt s gnawing away at him who does he blame his two buddies the real bad guys in this case what do you think he just goes out and executes them well it s no wilder than your kephardt theory is it no i guess it isn t if you re right we don t have to worry about any more killings ladies and gentlemen listen to what i m about to say the only person we have to worry about is sheila burke and i m worried who s in here don t move put your purse on the coffee table so this is the gun huh the one you use to kill rob and phil no that s my target pistol and i', 'just goes out and executes them well it s no wilder than your kephardt theory is it no i guess it

i m not going to wait around for you to kill me too jeffrey if you kill me they ll arrest you and put you in prison for life well i d rather be in jail than be dead why do you think i haven t been arrested because the police know somebody else did it nobody else had any reason to kill rob and phil david kephardt had all the motive in the world to want robert dead money you re trying to tell me that the police think rob s brother killed him yes that s crazy he didn t inherit rob s money the kephardt fund did to david kephardt it s all the same but in order to keep himself in the clear he had to kill phillip epperson first and he probably plans to kill you next i want to help you jeff you ve got to go somewhere and hide until the police arrest him and they do suspect him now you can go to my beach house in venice you can stay there he might look for me there are you kidding he thinks i want you killed why are you doing all this because i don t want to see you dead i just thought after what happened to rhonda whatever happened to rhonda is over it s gone and forgotten i just want this whole thing to stop so that i can have a phone again and go to work and be able to walk down the

he didn t know if his own wife was safe and very nearly died from his injuries my husband jason his bravery doesn t have anything to do with shooting a gun it s about getting up in the morning day in and day out like everyone who was traumatised by this horrific event the hotel staff the other guests there are too many people to count she sniffs so thank you thank you all i will accept this on behalf of those people all the people who don t get awards but really do deserve them just for living with memories that no one should have to live with thank you thank you ma am i tried to turn down
